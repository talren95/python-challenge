# python-challenge

Inside the "python-challenge" directory, you'll find two folders: "PyBank" and "PyPoll", each containing their respective Python files named "main.py".
To ensure smooth execution, I developed this script using Python in VS Code. For optimal functionality, open the "python-challenge" folder as the main directory in VS Code.
When you run this code, you'll view the results in the terminal. Additionally, a text file with those same results will be generated (after running the script) within the "Analysis" folders located in "PyBank" and "PyPoll" respectively.

In tackling this project, I utilized resources like YouTube, StackOverflow, Reddit, ChatGPT, and sought guidance from my TA. While the challenge posed was manageable, I encountered a hurdle in exporting my results into a text file and redirecting its output. Fortunately, my TA came to the rescue by sharing a valuable reference from W3Schools Online, which ultimately led me to a solution.
