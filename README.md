# python-challenge

Within the "python-challenge" folder, there should be 2 folders named "PyBank" and "PyPoll" both containing their respective python files under the name of "main.py".
For this script I used Python in VSCode and the "python-challenge" folder should be the main directory to open in VSCode to have the code run properly.
Upon running this code you should see the results in terminal, as well as a text file (which will be created after running the script) with a copy of those results in the "Analysis" folder (respectively in "PyBank" and "PyPoll" upon running each code).


For this project, I gained some help from YouTube, StackOverflow, Reddit, ChatGPT, and my TA. Overall, I believe this challenge was not too difficult, my maain issue was with having my results export as a text file and hving to redirect the output of that text file. The solution came to me with the help of my TA, who provided me a helpful reference on W3Schools Online.
