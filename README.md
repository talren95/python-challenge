# python-challenge

Inside the "python-challenge" directory, you'll find two folders: "PyBan" and "PyPoll", each containing their respective Python files named "main.py".
To ensure smooth execution, I developed this script using Python in VS Code. For optimal functionality, open the "python-challenge" folder as the main directory in VS Code.
When you run this code, you'll view the results in the terminal. Additionally, a text file with those same results will be generated (after running the script) within the "Analysis" folders located in "PyBank" and "PyPoll" respectively.

For this project, I gained some help from YouTube, StackOverflow, Reddit, ChatGPT, and my TA. Overall, I believe this challenge was not too difficult, my maain issue was with having my results export as a text file and hving to redirect the output of that text file. The solution came to me with the help of my TA, who provided me a helpful reference on W3Schools Online.
